## Change Log

12-11-2023 6:30pm - Implemented a fully functional front-end running on `local server` using React Carousel, which displays books based on availability status that the user selects from drop-down. Utilized `BrowserRouter` to store the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URLs and navigates using the browser's built-in history stack.
